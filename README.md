# US Wind Turbine Database Example

Ensure you have `anaconda-project` installed in your base environment:

```
$ conda install anaconda-project
```

Then, run the project as a notebook or as a Panel dashboard:

```
$ anaconda-project run notebook
$ anaconda-project run dashboard
```

You can also use `conda-project` if you have it:

```
$ conda project run notebook
$ conda project run dashboard
```
